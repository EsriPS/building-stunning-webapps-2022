# Building Stunning Web Apps

This readme will serve as a quick reference page for the 2022 Esri UC Preconference Seminar: **Building Stunning Web Apps**

In this repo, you can find:

1. The source code for "Discover Colorado" â€“Â the project we will be using to showcase what it takes to build stunning web apps. We've built this app up incrementally so you can follow along and see the major stages of a web dev project.
2. This readme, with the agenda and links to resources we will reference throughout the workshop.

## Agenda

## Code Links

Look here for quick links to get to the incremental builds of the Discover Colorado app. We've created a separate git branch for each "module". In addition to that, you can check out the app running at each of these stages using the links below.

#### 0. Starter

We'll start with nothing more than the output of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), a command line tool built by the React team (`npx create-react-app`).

#### 1. The foundations

This represents our prototypical "boilerplate" application. It comes with all the foundational bits and pieces we at Esri use most often â€“Â developer tooling, a UI library, a router, and a few other nuggets.

#### 2. Adding layout

This branch builds upon our boilerplate and adds some opinionated structure to our app. We'll start using React and Styled Components to see our app take shape. This is when we start writing code specific to the Discover Colorado project.

#### 3. Components!

One of (if not _the_) thesis of this workshop is to "think in components". We will talk about lots of benefits to this approach but we'll also roll up our sleeves and show you how the ~sausage~ components are made here at Esri ðŸ˜„.

#### 4. App state and (finally)... some GIS!

This module represents our final product for this workshop app. We'll take the layouts and our new box of components and put some brains into the app. We introduce some more advanced concepts here, like the global state, lifecycle methods, and lots of JSAPI goodness... but we'll be sure to hammer home the concepts first so you can follow along.
